<p>Mutations in <span id="geneName">TMEM260</span> Cause a Pediatric Neurodevelopmental, Cardiac, and Renal Syndrome</p>
<p>
We consulted family 1, a consanguineous Ashkenazi Jewish pedigree, who had experienced three 
recurrent births with cardiac complications that resulted in perinatal lethality in two of the 
three children (Figure 1A). Male and female individuals 1-II-1 and 1-II-2, respectively, were 
born at term and presented with central cyanosis and heart murmur shortly after birth. 
Echocardiography of 1-II-1 revealed a complex heart defect including 
<span id="hpoLookupTerm">truncus arteriosus</span>, 
a ventricular septal defect (VSD), an interrupted aortic arch, and a partial anomalous 
pulmonary venous return.
